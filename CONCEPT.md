# autofound.ai — Concept Document

## Tagline
**Company formation on autopilot. Fully AI, zero humans in the loop.**

## Problem
Forming a company (especially in the US as a non-US founder) is a maze of paperwork, compliance deadlines, and overpriced middlemen. Current solutions:

| Competitor | Price | Pain Points |
|---|---|---|
| **Stripe Atlas** | $500 setup + $100/yr | Delaware only, limited post-formation support, premium pricing |
| **Firstbase** | ~$399+ | Notorious delays (2+ months), terrible support, hidden fees |
| **doola** | $297+ (premium $329/mo) | Good for non-US founders but expensive at scale, human-dependent |
| **ZenBusiness** | $0 + state fees | Cheap but basic, US-focused, upsell heavy |
| **Clerky** | $799 | Dev-focused, limited scope, no ongoing support |
| **LegalZoom** | Varies | Legacy brand, slow, not startup-friendly |

**Common complaints across all:** slow processing, human bottlenecks, opaque pricing, compliance gaps, poor communication.

## Solution
